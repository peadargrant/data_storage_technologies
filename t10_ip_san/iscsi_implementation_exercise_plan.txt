ISCSI IMPLEMENTATION EXERCISE
=============================

Going to set up iSCSI and connect to it as a "secondary" (non-boot) drive.


You can do this exercise on your own. Or,
You *can* work with someone else if you want.
BUT, you should understand both parts of what's going on.


Diagram it out.
Try to be specific around IQNs + the like.


Create a basic Linux VM using Ubuntu.
Create a small (e.g. 2-5 GB) disk image file.
Set it up as an iSCSI target, no authentication, any initiator can connect.

Use the host (or 2nd lab machine in Windows or windows VM)'s initiator to connect to the shared LUN.

Now, create a second disk image, second target, with single LUN in it.
Set up a 2nd Linux VM as a guest and connect using the instructions.
