=============
ISCSI TARGETS
=============

So far have concentrated on iSCSI initiators / networking side.
Need to consider iSCSI targets too.

Larger data centre applications would have dedicated iSCSI array
       - usual vendors.

Smaller setups:
	- "lab" environment for learning, maybe virtual
	- DIY setups (e.g. Raspberry Pi's)
	- testing / proof-of-concept environments
	- low-usage environments
All of these can be done with software.

Usual approach:
- Standard server OS (Linux / UNIX easiest)
- Decide on a device or disk image file to make available (LUN)
- Group together in a target
- Install a target server [already in Linux kernel]
- Then connect from initiator (or hardware HBA)

Linux : TGT already in kernel

Demo setup of iSCSI on Linux server
Then connect & format on Windows server
