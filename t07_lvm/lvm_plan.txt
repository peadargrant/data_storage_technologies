LOGICAL VOLUME MANAGERS
=======================

Already have mentioned the idea of partitioning and thin/thick provisioning.
Want to clearly separate two different roles: layout OF volumes, and layout WITHIN volumes.

SOFT SAN: thin provisioning on normal PC hardware

iSCSI target server: makes LUNs out of block devices
What about these block devices?
Most basic - can be a hard disk or partition.
RAID + Thin provisioning: volume manager.


VOLUME MANAGER:

Physical Volume (PV) (i.e. a physical hard disk, LUN)
Spans Physical Extents (PE)
Volume Groups (VG) combine physical volumes into storage pools.
Logical Volume (LV) seen as block device by host OS

Windows has logical disk management service.
Linux has LVM + others.


DISK IMAGE FILES:

Simply a very thin "logical volume" that's actually stored as a file.
Great for basic experimentation with iSCSI.


iSCSI TARGET SERVER:
Can export either physical hard disks OR logical volumes as block devices.


FILESYSTEM:

Filesystem is an OS-construct to lay out files on to the physical blocks.
FAT ---------
NTFS--------|
ext3/4------+--  filesystems for block-level devices
HFS+/APFS---|
		(also have "fake" filesystems to map to NFS/SMB)



Also have combined VOLUME MANAGERS + FILESYSTEMS:
- ZFS: Sun, now Oracle, in FreeBSD and Linux.
- BTRFS: Linux
Later on!
VERY useful for building a cheap server without having to worry too much about LVM+filesystem.
