% DST CA2 specification

**This CA replaces your entire CA mark in Data Storage Technologies.**

**Due date:** as on Moodle

Introduction
============

This CA is a research / design project on data storage technologies. You are
required to take a non-trivial LAN / WAN / data-centre-centric (which
may include cloud components) storage problem that we have not already
discussed in class, and propose a solution for it.

Deliverables
============

In a single ZIP file `ca2.zip` you must provide:

Aims (20%)
----------

Explaining the broad area of study, the problem that you are going to
address, the key factors (cost, security, longevity) and the rationale
for its study.
Bullet point form preferred (target 3-6 bullets).
Must be in plain text `aims.txt`.

Architectural diagram (30%) {#sec:architectural-diagram}
---------------------------

Architectural diagram should be 1 page PDF named `architecture.pdf`.
Provide as much technical detail as possible.

Minimum factors to consider: storage architecture purpose (boot,
additional, backup), storage architecture, fabric details, network
segmentation, initiator type for SAN-attached hosts.
Additional Factors to consider: redundancy, remote management, power supply.

Implementation (30%)
--------------------

Provide a implementation plan in max 2 page PDF `implementation.pdf`.
This should detail step-by-step how to build the architecture.
You should provide the commands or script files for some operations, if possible.

Limitations (20%)
-----------------

Identify 2-4 limitations in your design as bullet points in `limitations.txt`.
Are the limitations justifiable in the context of the problem you set out to solve?

Presentation
============

This CA may require demonstration / presentation (no slides required).
To be scheduled by the lecturer after the deadline.
Submissions received where student does not attend for demonstration will receive zero.
