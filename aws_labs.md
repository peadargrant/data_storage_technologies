# AWS Labs

There are a number of labs primarily for demonstration using AWS.
You are welcome to use them to help your learning in data storage technologies.
This is *not* a course in cloud architecture, however.

- A number of choices are not considered best practice in cloud architecture.
- The configurations used are **not very secure**. 
- Some labs require multiple instances and **will cost money** or use credit if setup.
