===============================
FIBRE CHANNEL SAN MESH TOPOLOGY
===============================

GENERAL TOPOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES TO IP NETWORKS
| SANS Tend to be relatively confined spatially
| SANS Tend to be higher cost
| Often perceived "higher stakes" with SANs
| Organisational split: storage staff vs networking staff "turf war"
Like in IP networks, have general topologies.

** STANDARD TOPOLOGIES ** (draw as tree)

TOPOLOGIES SO FAR
Point-to-point
FC-AL via loop 
FC-AL via hub: logically ring, physically star
>> REMAINING TOPOLOGIES WILL HAVE SAME LOGICAL/PHYSICAL TOPOLOGY <<

SINGLE SWITCH TOPOLOGY
| Single switch
| Becoming more popular
| #Ports vs $ increasing
| Larger modular switches with cards

--- MESH TOPOLOGIES ---

MESH TOPOLOGY: FULL MESH
| Multiple switches
| All switches directly connected to each other
| Usually about 3-4 switches : any more too much E ports.
| Maximum of 1 ISL to be traversed.
| Hop count: how many ISLs are to be traversed?

PARTIAL MESH TOPOLOGY: FULL MESH w/o SOME LINKS
| More scalable.
| Need to think / work out the topology to make sense.
| Traffic may need >1 ISL from source to destination.
| ISL overloading


--- CORE-EDGE TOPOLOGIES ---

Two "tiers" of switches: edge and core tiers.
Hosts attached to edge tier switches.
Edge switches:
| have ISLs to central "core" switch. 
| are NOT connected to each other (helps port utilisation)
| Storage devices only connected to core tier.
| High-performance hosts may be directly connected to core tier.
| Keeps hop count to 1.
| Single-core-topology
| Dual-core topology: add second core switch, links to each edge switch.

COMPLEX CORE-EDGE topology
| Same as above, but mesh only between cores.
| Edge switches not connected to all cores.


-- FAN IN/OUT --

Fan Out : multiple server ports communicate with single storage port.
(front-end ~ throughput) 
Fan in: single HBA communicates with multiple storage units. (HBA limits)


DIRECTOR-CLASS SWITCHES : ambiguous.
