FIBRE CHANNEL SAN
-----------------

Review of class test : very impressive results.
If concerned about any questions please come and see me after.

Chapter 5 in book

Most ideas same in principle as iSCSI over TCP/IP over ethernet...
-    just that the component differ
-    exact protocols used differ also
-    multiple hosts (or servers)
-    largely the same drivers as with iSCSI
     (recap: consolidate, ease of backup, management etc)

Nomenclature / Components:
-------------------------
Hosts and Storage appliances both called NODES.
Node Ports
| HBA cards on servers
| Storage front-end controllers
| Port operates full-duplex

Cables:
------
| By name: optical fibre
| | MMF (OM1, OM2, OM3=laser optimised)
| | | modal dispersion at longer distancees
| | | SPDIF-like cable.
| | SMF: more expensive, faster, longer distances
| | Standardised connectors: SC, LC, ST
| Copper used for short distances (<=30m)

Interconnect:
------------
Hubs - same idea as ethernet, but more like a loop internally
Switches - directly route from one node to another
Director - high-end switch

FC CONNECTIVITY
---------------

POINT-TO-POINT:
Simplest: point-to-point
Crossover cable/fibre!

FIBRE-CHANNEL ARBITRATED LOOP:
| Logical: token-ring (need to explain!)
| Devices must ARBITRATE to gain controll of the loop.
| 1 device at a time in charge.
| Can implement as shown without any interconnects.
| Physical: loop OK but usually star using a HUB
| 8-bit addressing: 127 addresses, 1 reserved (uplink), so 126.
| add/drop device: loop reinitialisation

FIBRE-CHANNEL SWITCHED FABRIC:
Fabric: logical space where all nodes communicate with one another
More or less same as Ethernet switching.
Each switch has "domain identifier", part of FC addressing scheme.
Switches connected via ISL ( inter-switch links )
Fabric described by number of tiers (#switches traffic must traverse)
Implications for fabric-management traffic.

PORT TYPES:
N_Port: end point on HBA or storage array
E_Port: forms connection between two FC switches. (expansion port) for ISLs
F_Port: switch port for connection to N_Port
G_Port: can act as E_Port or F_Port, auto setup.
