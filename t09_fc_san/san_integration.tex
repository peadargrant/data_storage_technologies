\section{SAN integration}
\label{sec:san-integration}

FC SAN primarily is a highly reliable, high-perforamance,
data-centre-centric solution that comes at considerable cost. The FCP is
non-routable, and is therefored confined spatially. Often we want to
broaden access to our existing FC SAN by means of integration
technologies.

Generally, we shouldn't start out building a SAN that needs to use these
primarily. Like WiFi-extenders, poorly thought-out SAN integration can
do more harm than good!

\section{Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)}
\label{sec:fibre-channel-over-ethernet-fcoe}

FCoE is where FCP runs over existing ethernet infrastructure, usually on
CAT5/6 cabling. It can coexist with LAN traffic. Normally its used to
connect ethernet-attached hosts to an existing FC SAN fabric.

Layers 1 and 2 are the same we are familiar with from IP networking. The
key difference occurs at Layer 3: FCP is encapsulated in ethernet
frames.

\subsection{FCoE frame format}
\label{sec:fcoe-frame-format}

\autoref{fig:fcoe-frame} shows the format of a FCoE frame.
The Ethertype denotes the frame as FCoE (as opposed to IP).

\subsection{FCoE fabric}
\label{sec:fcoe-fabric}

FC natively has a lossless transport. Protocols such as IP running over
ethernet normally are tolerant of frames being dropped when congestion
is high. FCoE requires extensions to the ethernet protocol to guarantee
lossless transmission, called Priority Flow Control.

In practical terms, we need to use a FCoE-aware switch.

\subsection{FCoE-FC gateway}
\label{sec:fcoe-fc-gateway}

A FCoE gateway will connect FCoE devices to an existing FC network, .
The gateway acts as a so-called fibre channel forwarder to bridge the
FCoE to the FC. Additionally it provides the normal fabric services.

\autoimage{fcoe_gateway}{FCoE gateway}{fcoe-gateway}

This is actually quite a complex process under the hood, as mapping is
required from WWNs to MAC addresses. The gateway device is often a FC
switch/director with an FCoE card fitted.

\subsection{FCoE host hardware}
\label{sec:fcoe-host-hardware}

Hosts traditionally use a FCoE HBA to connect to the FCoE-provided
fabric. Software initiators are theoretically possible, like
\texttt{open-fcoe} but are unusual to see in use.

Since FCoE and IP LAN traffic run over ethernet, we can converge the two
using a FCoE Converged Networking Adapter. This is similar to the CNA we
discussed for iSCSI, in that it includes the SAN HBA and NIC on one
card. shows a CNA handling both sets of traffic which split at a
FCoE-aware switch.

\autoimage{fcoe_cna}{FCoE converged networking (Wikipedia)}{fcoe-cna}

It is generally recommended that VLANs are used to separate FCoE and IP
traffic where they co-exist.

\subsection{FCoE Application Areas}
\label{sec:fcoe-application-areas}

FCoE's primary purpose is to extend FC SAN by re-using CAT-6 cabling
and/or existing ethernet networking. It would be highly unusual to build
an entire SAN primarily around FCoE.

Although converged networking is beneficial in many applications, FCoE
would not be a primary means of doing so.

FCoE requires gateways, FCoE-aware switches and other expensive
hardware. It is normally not cost effective compared to IP SAN.

FCoE is not routable, and can't cross Layer-2 boundaries. Therefore it's
primarily seen within a data centre or single-building environment.

\textbf{In summary, FCoE is best used to connect hosts to an existing FC
SAN over CAT5/6-carried ethernet where it is impractical to extend the
FC SAN directly to them.}

\section{Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP)}
\label{sec:fibre-channel-over-ip}

Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP) encapsulates fibre channel within IP
packets on an existing IP network. FCIP is normally used to tunnel
directly between two remote FC networks, , and is not used by individual
hosts.

\autoimage{fcip_network}{FC san extended using FCIP (TechTarget)}{fcip-network}

Configuration is generally needed of the two bridges and the network
between them. The encapsulation process does lower performance compared
to native FC or FCoE.

\subsection{FCIP Application areas}
\label{sec:fcip-application-areas}

\textbf{Generally FCIP is appropriate where we need to bridge two
physically remote FC networks into one fabric across a routed IP or WAN
link.} It is our only option when the link involves a WAN or having to
cross Layer-2 boundaries.

If the two FC networks can be connected directly CAT5/6 then FCoE may be
more suitable than FCIP.

Given that the FCIP link is slower than other links in the FC fabric, it
works best where there is comparatively little traffic on the bridged
link. FCIP is therefore good for scenarios like offsite backup,
replication and accessing archival storage.

\section{FC-iSCSI integration}
\label{sec:fc-iscsi-integration}

FC and iSCSI both encapsulate SCSI commands, so conceptally they can be
bridged. This is normally done using a FC to iSCSI gateway, . As iSCSI
runs over TCP/IP it is routable across Layer-2 boundaries.

\subsection{Application areas}
\label{sec:application-areas}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Leveraging existing FC SAN for lower-traffic hosts at minimal cost
  using software initiators or inbuilt HBAs.
\item
  Allowing iSCSI-capable workstations to directly access FC-SAN storage.
\item
  Giving access to FC SAN for servers that need to be located distant
  from the FC SAN.
\end{itemize}
