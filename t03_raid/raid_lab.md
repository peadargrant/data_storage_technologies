1.  Generate the truth table for the XOR operation.

2.  In a RAID-5 set, data is split in a stripe into 4 data blocks and
    one parity block. The first bit of each block in a particular stripe
    is `1 1 0 1`. Determine the corresponding bit in the parity block.

3.  In a RAID-5 set, data is split in a stripe into 5 data blocks and
    one parity block. The 3rd bit of each block is `1 1 1 ? 1`, where
    `?` denotes a block that cannot be read. The corresponding bit in
    the parity block is 1. Determine the value of the unknown data bit.

4.  If possible, determine how many disks are required to store 750GB in
    a single RAID-0 set if only 300GB disks are available.

5.  If possible, determine how many disks are required to store 750GB in
    a single RAID-1 set if only 300GB disks are available.

6.  Calculate the storage efficiency of a 4-disk set in RAID-5.

7.  Determine the minimum number of disks required to achieve a 90%
    storage efficiency in RAID-5.

8.  Determine the minimum number of disks required to achieve an 85%
    storage efficiency in RAID-6.
